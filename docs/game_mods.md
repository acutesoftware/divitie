# Mods
There are several ways to customise the game

### In Game Modifications
Each player has a home base they can modify. 
From any land, take a boat to "Home Town" and turn left into the glowing portal saying "Home"
(you should also be able to use a Hearthstone)

The players home base is a reasonably size flat block of land, surrounded by cliffs that you can modify as you see fit.

You can place any buildings on there once you get the materials, and add the following features
- Rocks
- Fishing pool(s)
- Trees
- plants
- random forage spawns (Ore, Herbs, etc)


### External Mods

For external mods, you create data files and import them with a script.

The following mods will be supported
- Items - define a new item: name, material, texture [not 100% sure if full static mesh will be importable - may need to use existing termplate]
- Crafting Recipes - using existing items in the world (including ones you add), make your own recipes
- NPC's - customise the look of an NPC with the character creator, give them a back story and goals
- Quests - quests for players to try out, using in game or generated items
- Biomes - add tree spawners, plants, rocks, fishing spots, animal spawners to the land
