<div>
<H2>Stategies for play</H2>
You will not be able to max out all areas of wealth as there is simply not enough time in the day.
You have to decide which areas to focus on.<BR><BR>

It is a good idea to have a 'little' wealth in all areas, and you can choose either
<LI>a) focus on 1 area and get to the top fast
<LI>b) focus on a couple of areas
<LI>c) live a well balanced life [there is a separate achievement for this, not counting the standard measures of wealth]

<H2>How the game works</H2>
You have 50 years to achieve wealth. <BR>
You set your character on the path you want by choosing those quests.<BR>
Offline mode allows characters to train / practice when you are not online<BR>
